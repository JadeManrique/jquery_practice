<dl id="biography">

  <dt> My Name </dt>
  <dd> My name is Jade Aeon Manrique. Jade was chosen out from a random resturant or building in Los Angeles, but apparently as a baby, I would go crazy when we went near it. Aeon was a name from a character a show my parents watched called, Aeon Flux. Manrique apparently means travelling painter according to google. </dd>

  <dt> Location </dt>
  <dd> My baby years were in Los Angeles. I lived in the nicer areas. We moved to San Francisco for my mom's work when I was 9 or 10. The rest of my teen years were in the Bay Area. Up until I left for college. </dd>

  <dt> College </dt>
  <dd> I went to College of Marin in highschool for film studies, journalism and nutrition. After my senior year of highschool, I went to the Santa Barara City College for graphic design and film. I am currently out of any institution and take various courses around the Bay Area for computer programming. </dd>

  <dt> Walking </dt>
  <dd> I began to love walking around during high school when people were bored and had no money. Plus the city was great for aimless walking. At one point it turned into something where I don't know when to stop walking. It has become a great, entertaining challenege to see how far I can walk without completely giving up. So far I have gone around 20 miles in one day. I try to walk around an average 8-10 miles a day. </dd>

  <dt> Art </dt>
  <dd> I have been playing guitar since I was 7. I wasn't good nor was I practicing, but we had a guitar in the house I would play the easy Nirvana licks on it. </dd>
